Slide 2: Introduction to SDG 14
Content:
SDG 14 focuses on protecting oceans, seas, and marine resources.
Healthy oceans are essential for food security, climate regulation, and biodiversity.
Oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface and are home to millions of species.

Slide 3: Key Targets of SDG 14
Content:
Conserve marine resources: Protect vital habitats like coral reefs and mangroves.
Eliminate harmful subsidies: Stop financial support that encourages overfishing and habitat destruction.
Enhance scientific research: Improve understanding of marine ecosystems to inform policy and management.
Sustainable fishing practices: Promote methods that do not deplete fish stocks.

Slide 4: Importance of Marine Ecosystems
Content:
Oceans provide food for billions of people worldwide through fishing.
They regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and heat.
Marine tourism generates significant revenue and provides jobs.
Healthy ecosystems support biodiversity, which is crucial for resilience.

Slide 5: Current Global Challenges
Content:
Overfishing: Depletes fish stocks and disrupts ecosystems.
Pollution: Plastics and chemicals harm marine life and habitats.
Climate change: Leads to ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and rising sea levels.
Habitat destruction: Coastal development threatens vital ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses.

Slide 6: India’s Marine Biodiversity
Content:
India has a coastline of over 7,500 km, rich in marine biodiversity.
Home to diverse species, including dolphins, turtles, and various fish.
The Indian Ocean supports traditional fishing communities and economies.
Important ecosystems like the Sundarbans mangroves and coral reefs are found here.

Slide 7: Challenges Faced by India
Content:
Overfishing: Unsustainable practices threaten fish populations and livelihoods.
Pollution: Urban runoff and plastic waste severely impact marine health.
Coastal erosion: Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and biodiversity.
Climate change: Affects monsoon patterns and marine ecosystems, leading to habitat loss.

Slide 8: Government Initiatives
Content:
National Policy on Marine Fisheries: Aims to regulate fishing practices and ensure sustainability.
Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notifications: Protects coastal ecosystems from unplanned development.
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs): Designated zones to conserve marine biodiversity and resources.
Awareness campaigns: Educating communities about sustainable practices and ocean conservation.

Slide 9: Community Involvement
Content:
Local communities play a crucial role in protecting marine resources.
Traditional fishing practices often promote sustainability and biodiversity.
Successful community-led initiatives can serve as models for conservation.
Engaging youth and local stakeholders is essential for effective conservation.

Slide 10: Case Study: Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
Content:
India has established several MPAs to protect marine biodiversity.
Examples include the Gulf of Mannar and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
MPAs help restore fish populations and preserve critical habitats.
Monitoring and enforcement are essential for their success.

Slide 11: Campaign: “Swachh Sagar, Surakshit Sagar”
Content:
Overview: Launched by the Government of India, this campaign aims to clean coastlines and promote sustainable practices in marine environments.
Objectives:
Reduce marine pollution, particularly plastic waste.
Raise awareness about the importance of ocean health.
Involve local communities and stakeholders in cleanup activities.
Activities: Beach clean-ups, awareness programs, and educational workshops for schools and communities.
Impact: Encourages collective action for ocean conservation and inspires grassroots movements.

Slide 12: Data Representation: Sources of Marine Pollution in India
Content:
Overview: Pie chart showing the distribution of marine pollution sources in India.
Suggested Data Breakdown:
Plastic Waste: 45% (largest contributor, including single-use plastics)
Sewage and Wastewater: 25% (untreated sewage discharge)
Industrial Discharge: 15% (toxic substances from factories)
Agricultural Runoff: 10% (pesticides and fertilizers entering water bodies)
Others: 5% (shipping waste, oil spills, etc.)
Significance: Understanding pollution sources helps in formulating effective policies for marine conservation.

Slide 13: Future Directions and Solutions
Content:
Promote sustainable fishing methods to protect fish stocks.
Implement better waste management to reduce marine pollution.
Strengthen policies to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems.
Encourage international cooperation for global ocean health.
